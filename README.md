# Reader-for-piano-notes
Project for course CI-0112, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Reads from a .csv file the intensity for the notes of a piano piece and projects them on a simple GUI simulating a piano.
Implementation is done in Bluej, will throw errors if not executed on it.

## How to use 
Create an "Enviroment" instance in Bluej, a GUI will pop up. Hit the "run" botton, where the notes for a default piece will be "played". 

## Note
The GUI code is taken from https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/resources/projects.zip
